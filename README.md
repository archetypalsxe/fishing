# Fishing Game
This is a pointless, non-interactive Java fishing simulator. I would like to point out that I am a vegan and a strong animal rights activist. I personally strongly oppose fishing and think that it should be illegal. I started this "game" a couple of years ago as a joke to have with some friends. In this "game", you literally don't do anything. You wait and randomly catch fish to gain experience and level up. There is literally no user interaction.
